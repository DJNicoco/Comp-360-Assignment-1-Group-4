# COMP360 â€” 2D and 3D Images

We generated a 2D image with FastNoiseLite using multiple octaves of cellular noise and created a grid of 3D quads with the height of their vertices controlled by an image created using FastNoiseLite for a more natural-looking landscape.

## Planning and Logging

- All members created their own 2D and 3D attempts. 
- We shared and voted on Discord to decide which images to submit.
- Proof of this discussion is included here: [View all Discord proof screenshots](2D%20and%203D%20Image%20Attempts)
