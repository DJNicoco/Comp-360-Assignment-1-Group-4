# COMP360 â€” 2D and 3D Images

## Folder Structure
We generated a 2D image with FastNoiseLite using multiple octaves of cellular noise and created a grid of 3D quads with the height of their vertices controlled by an image created using FastNoiseLite for a more natural-looking landscape.

(Code goes here).

## Roles (7 people)

We each created our own images and we voted on which 2D and 3D images to use for our submission.
